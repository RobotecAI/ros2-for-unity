# ROS2 For Unity - Windows 10

This readme contains information specific to Window 10. For general information, please see [README.md](README.md).

## Building

We assume that working directory is `C:\dev` and we are using `ROS2 galactic` (replace with `foxy` or `humble` where applicable).

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to complete all the steps for `ros2cs` [Prerequisites](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.md#prerequisites) and consider [Important notices](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.md#important-notices) sections.

### Steps

* Make sure [long paths on Windows are enabled](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.md#important-notices)
* Make sure you open [`Developer PowerShell for VS` with administrator privileges](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.md#important-notices)
* For `ros2 galactic` distribution, it is best to [create a `C:\ci\ws\install\include` directory](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ros2cs/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.md#important-notices)
* Clone this project.
  ```powershell
  git clone git@github.com:RobotecAI/ros2-for-unity.git C:\dev\ros2-for-unity
  ```
* Source your ROS2 installation (`C:\dev\ros2_foxy\local_setup.ps1`) in the terminal before you proceed.
  ```
  C:\dev\ros2_foxy\local_setup.ps1
  ```
* Enter `Ros2ForUnity` working directory.
    ```powershell
    cd C:\dev\ros2-for-unity
    ```
* Set up you custom messages in `ros2_for_unity_custom_messages.repos`
* Import necessary and custom messages repositories.
    ```powershell
    .\pull_repositories.ps1
    ```
    > *NOTE* `pull_repositories.ps1` script doesn't update already existing repositories, you have to remove `src\ros2cs` folder to re-import new versions.
* Build `Ros2ForUnty`. You can build it in standalone or overlay mode.
    ```powershell
    # standalone mode
    ./build.ps1 -standalone
    
    # overlay mode
    ./build.ps1
    ```
  * You can build with `-clean_install` to make sure your installation directory is cleaned before deploying.
* Unity package is ready to import into your Unity project. You can find it in `install/package/` directory.

## Build troubleshooting

- If you see one of the following errors:
><script_name> is not digitally signed

><script_name> cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

Please execute `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` in PS shell session to enable third party scripts execution only for this session. Otherwise please refer to official [Execution Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.1).

- If you see the following error:

Please reinstall `numpy` package from python by typing:
```powershell
pip uninstall numpy
pip install numpy
```

## OS-Specific usage remarks

> If the package is built with `-standalone` flag (the default), then nothing extra needs to be done.
Otherwise, you have to source your ros distribution before launching either Unity3D Editor or Application.

> Note that after you build the package, you can use it on a machine that has no ros2 installation (if built with `-standalone`).
